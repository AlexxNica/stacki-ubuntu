This should now work reasonably well?

Use an ubuntu iso. I've tried xenial, which likely means
that wily and trusty work. Xenial takes a long time to install.

You'll want head of tree or get the imp_foreign_ubuntu.py for 
"stack add pallet" because it does the right thing for the
ubuntu-bridge pallet. 

Then:

create an ubuntu box.
Add stacki to it.
Add the Ubuntu-Server to it. 
Add the ubuntu-bridge to it.
stack run pallet ubuntu-bridge

(You might have to set the frontend to the "ubuntu" box 
for that to work.)

Then install. should work.
